              Hey there,<br /><br />
              We couldn't find an Account associated to your payment email, <b>${data.paymentEmail}</b>. This most likely happened because you changed the pre-filled email address while you were checking out.
              <br /><br />
              <b>Please reply</b> to this email with:
              <ul>
                <li>Your Username</li>
                <li>The email you used to sign up for typvp</li>
              </ul>
              <span>(All of this info can be found on your Profile page)</span>
              <br /> <br />
              and I will manually update your Account Email & Pro status! I'm <i>very</i> sorry for the inconvenience, the robots were supposed to do their job :(
              <br /><br />
              <span><b>P.S.</b> If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out. You can contact me by <u>replying to this email</u> or send me a reddit message â€” <u>u/what_is_productivity</u></span>
